# Example project for Apollo Server using `@as-integrations/google-cloud-functions` for Google Cloud Function deployments

This example project comes pre-configured with sane defaults for tooling that you can use to deploy Apollo Server on Google Cloud Functions.

## Quickstart

Install dependencies with the package manager of your choice:

```bash
npm install
```

Build your project:

```bash
npm run build
```

Test your project on the Google Cloud Framework development server:
```bash
npm start
```


This will build the project into a bundle usable by Google Cloud Functions and start a local development server using the `@google-cloud/functions-framework` package provided for Node.js runtimes. The server will be available at `http://localhost:8080` and will run with an Apollo Sandbox where you can test your queries.

## Deployment

> **Warning**
> Before making your first deployment, it's highly recommeded that you understand the difference between Cloud Functions 1st and 2nd generation. While Google recommends that you create new functions on 2nd gen whenever possible, they do not yet support deploying from source repositories, or have a published action for GitHub Actions, You can find more information [here](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/version-comparison).

### Local deployment

The project is configured to be deployed to Google Cloud Functions trough the Google Cloud CLI Tool. To deploy the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

To use the provided deploy script, you need to have the Google Cloud CLI Tool installed and configured on your machine. You can find more information about the CLI Tool [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud). The script will use the bundled output from the `/dist` directory.

> **Note**
> The deploy script currently uses POSIX compliant commands, and **will not work on Windows** (I encourage you to file an issue and/or open a pull request if you can help me solve this). If you're using Windows, you can use the `gcloud` CLI tool directly to deploy your function, and change the correct flags accordingly.
>
> Run the `build` command to generate the `/dist` output. Then run the GCloud CLI Tool with the following command:
>
> ```powershell
> gcloud functions deploy <function-name> --runtime nodejs16 --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated --entry-point=<function-name> --source=./dist
> ```
>
> Beware that the `--entry-point` flag should match the name of the function handler exported on the main file of the server application.

## FAQ

### I got an error `Provided code is not a loadable module` when trying to run the `start` command:

You'll get this error when there is no bundled output in the `/dist` directory. Make sure to run the `build` command before running the `start` command.

### I got an error `Function <function-name> is not defined in the provided module...` when trying to run/deploy my function:

The value of `--target` and `--entry-point` flags, on the `start` and `deploy` scripts, respective, should match the name of the function you export from the main file of your app. By default it is named `handler`.
